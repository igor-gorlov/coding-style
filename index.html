		<b><u>Welcome to Igor Gorlov's Coding Style Documentation</u></b>
	</h1>
	<p>
		In all times, people have been needing to unify their goals and methods
		in order to collaborate effectively. The legend of
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel" target="_blank">the&nbsp;Tower&nbsp;of&nbsp;Babel</a> can
		be considered an example of the contrary approach that had led to an epic fail. The simplest (and probably the
		most reliable) way to accomplish unification is defining common standards everyone (including myself) should
		follow. This collection of documents is nothing but a try to maintain consistency and readability of the code we
		write together. The rules present here are not dogmas, but I hope you will take them seriously anyway. On the
		other hand, it is clear that a human brain, especially such unexperienced brain like mine, has no ability to
		produce ultimate truth, so I count on your comments and contributions. Coding style documentation repository is
		hosted at

		<h2 align="center">Natural Language</h2>
		<p>
			The official language of our community is <strong>English</strong>. It should be used in almost every case
			where natural language is required, including the documentation, file and directory names, identifiers
			within the source code, commit messages, interaction between the community members, and so on. In personal
			communication with me, you can also use Russian.
