	</h1>
	<p>
		In all times, people have been needing to unify their goals and methods
		in order to collaborate effectively. The legend of
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel" target="_blank">the&nbsp;Tower&nbsp;of&nbsp;Babel</a> can
		be considered an example of the contrary approach that had led to an epic fail. The simplest (and probably the
		most reliable) way to accomplish unification is defining common standards everyone should follow. This
		collection of documents is nothing but a try to maintain consistency and readability of the code we write
		together. The rules present here are not dogmas, but I hope you will take them seriously anyway.
