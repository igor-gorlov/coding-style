		<h1>Welcome to Igor Gorlov's Coding Style Documentation</h1>
		<p>
			In all times, people have been needing to unify their goals and methods in order to collaborate effectively.
			The legend of
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel" target="_blank">
				<span class="non-breaking">the Tower of Babel</span>
			</a>
			can be considered an example of the contrary approach that had led to an epic fail. The simplest (and
			probably the most reliable) way to accomplish unification is defining common standards everyone (including
			myself) will follow.
		</p>
		<p>
			This collection of documents is nothing but a try to maintain consistency and readability of the code we
			write together. The rules present here are not dogmas, but I hope you will take them seriously anyway. On
			the other hand, it is clear that a human brain, especially such unexperienced brain like mine, has no
			ability to produce ultimate truth, so I count on your comments and contributions. Coding style documentation
			repository is hosted at
			<a href="https://github.com/igor-gorlov/coding-style"

			<h2>Select a Revision</h2>
			<p>
				The coding style documentation is being continuously developed. You can read its
				<a href="draft/">current draft</a> containing all latest changes; but be careful: the draft may be
				updated at any moment, and those updates may be critical, so it is probably a bad idea to use the
				bleeding-edge version as a set of rules for your project&nbsp;&mdash; a stable revision would be a
				better choice.
