## Code Snippets

To add a **multiline** fragment of raw program code into a document:

1. Create an HTML file with an informative name in "snippets" catalog; do **not** apply any template to it.
2. Insert the code fragment into the created file.
3. Surround the code with `<pre>...</pre>` tags.
4. Show this file's contents in a target document using **iframe**.
