		</h1>
		<p>
			The conventions established by this document, as well as ones established by other documents in this
			repository, are strongly encouraged to be followed by every programmer working on my projects. In the
			meantime, all these rules are not dogmas: developers have the right to neglect or even ignore them in
			special cases.
