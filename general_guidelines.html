			<b><u>General Coding Style Guidelines by Igor Gorlov</u></b>
		</h1>
		<p>
			The conventions established by this document, as well as ones established by other documents in this
			repository, are strongly encouraged to be followed by every programmer working on my projects. In the
			meantime, all these rules are not dogmas: developers have the right to neglect or even ignore them in
			special cases.

			<p>
				The official language of our community is <strong>English</strong>. It should be used in almost every
				case where natural language is required, including the documentation, file and directory names,
				identifiers within the source code, commit messages, interaction between the community members, and so
				on. In personal communication with me, you can also use Russian.
