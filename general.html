			<h2 id="terminology"><a href="#contents-terminology">Terminology</a></h2>
			<p>The following are some common terms used throughout the whole coding style documentation.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Spaceless case</dt>
				<dd>
					A collective name for several styles of phrase writing in which whitespaces are <strong>not</strong>
					used.
				</dd>
				<dt>Upper camel case</dt>
				<dd>
					A spaceless case where <strong>each</strong> word of the phrase being written begins with a
					<strong class="non-breaking">capital letter</strong>.
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>Example</td>
							<td>
								<code>SpacesAreNotAllowedHere</code>
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</dd>
				<dt>Lower camel case</dt>
				<dd>
					A spaceless case where <strong>each</strong> word of the phrase being written, except of the first
					one, begins with a <strong class="non-breaking">capital letter</strong>.
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>Example</td>
							<td>
								<code>spacesAreNotAllowedHere</code>
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</dd>
				<dt>Upper snake case</dt>
				<dd>
					A spaceless case using an <strong class="non-breaking">underscore character (_)</strong> as a word
					separator and requiring <strong>all</strong> letters to be <strong>capital</strong>.
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>Example</td>
							<td>
								<code>SPACES_ARE_NOT_ALLOWED_HERE</code>
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</dd>
				<dt>Lower snake case</dt>
				<dd>
					A spaceless case using an <strong class="non-breaking">underscore character (_)</strong> as a word
					separator and <strong class="non-breaking">totally prohibiting</strong> capital letters.
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>Example</td>
							<td>
								<code>spaces_are_not_allowed_here</code>
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</dd>
				<dt>Git case</dt>
				<dd>
					A spaceless case using <strong class="non-breaking">hyphen character (-)</strong> as a word
					separator and <strong class="non-breaking">totally prohibiting</strong> capital letters.
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>Example</td>
							<td>
								<code>spaces-are-not-allowed-here</code>
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</dd>
				<dt>Archient (architectural entity)</dt>
				<dd>
					A relatively independent part of a codebase (for example, a class or a module) which can (but is not
					required to) include other archients. Very small code fragments, such as getter/setter methods in
					C++, are <strong>never</strong> considered to be archients.
				</dd>
				<dt>Archichange (architectural change)</dt>
				<dd>
					An act of <strong>creating</strong>, <strong>deleting</strong>, <strong>renaming</strong>,
					<strong>replacing</strong> or <strong>relocating</strong> archients.
				</dd>
				<dt>Archiname (architectural name)</dt>
				<dd>A short <strong class="non-breaking">Git-cased</strong> identifier of an archient.</dd>
				<dt>Archititle (architectural title)</dt>
				<dd>
					A real name of an archient by which this archient is known across the codebase (for example, an
					exact name of a class).
				</dd>
				<dt>File archient</dt>
				<dd>An archient exactly matching a single filesystem object (a file or a directory).</dd>
				<dt>Archiroot (architectural root)</dt>
				<dd>
					The topmost archient which includes all other archients the project comprizes of. An archiroot have
					<strong>no</strong> archiname, and its archititle is identical to the project name.
				</dd>
				<dt>Line terminator</dt>
				<dd>
					A character intended to finish a line of text, also widely known as
					<span class="non-breaking">end-of-line</span>, newline or linebreak (for example, CRLF on Windows or
					LF on Unix-compatible systems).
				</dd>

			<h2 id="project"><a href="#contents-project">Project Basics</a></h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Encode <strong>all</strong> files within a repository in
					<strong class="non-breaking">UTF-8</strong>.
				</li>
				<li>Finish any file with a <strong class="non-breaking">line terminator</strong>.</li>
				<li>Name the root directory of a project in <strong class="non-breaking">Git case</strong>.</li>
				<li>
					Use <strong class="non-breaking">lower snake case</strong> to name <strong>all</strong> files and
					directories which are (recursively) located within the root directory of a project.
				</li>
				<li>For indentation use <strong class="non-breaking">tabs (one per level)</strong>, not spaces.</li>
				<li>Keep line length <strong>not</strong> higher than <strong>120</strong> columns.</li>
				<li>Do <strong>not</strong> write source files consisting of more than <strong>1000</strong> lines.</li>
				<li>
					To simplify creation of new files with initial content or insertion of frequently repeated code
					fragments into existing files, you can make a &quot;<strong>.templates</strong>&quot; catalog within
					the root directory of your project and store samples there.
				</li>
			</ul>

		<section>
			<h2 id="metafiles"><a href="#contents-metafiles">Metafiles</a></h2>
			<p>
				<dfn>Metafiles</dfn> are special helper documents placed at the top level of each project. In fact, they
				are more of a annotation of the codebase rather than its part. Only documents covered in the current
				section are considered metafiles; various tool-specific configs <strong>never</strong> fall into this
				category.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some metafiles are <strong>mandatory</strong>, others are <strong>optional</strong>; such status is
				explicitly pointed out for each document (see the next subsections).
			</p>
			<section>
				<h3 id="metafiles-architecture"><a href="#contents-metafiles-architecture">architecture.md</a></h3>
				<p>
					This <strong>mandatory</strong> metafile maps archititles to appropriate archinames, and therefore
					serves as a reminder for developers. Also, &quot;architecture.md&quot; has an auxiliary function: it
					gives a quick high-level overview of the codebase and helps to understand relations between all
					components.
				</p>
				<p>
					The document must remain actual at any time and thus is required to be updated on
					<strong class="non-breaking">every archichange</strong>. The update is performed by the same commit
					which applies the architectural change itself.
				</p>
				<p>The following is a set of rules &quot;architecture.md&quot; should comply with:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The document begins with a <strong class="non-breaking">level 1 header</strong> exactly matching
						the name of the project.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>File</strong> archients of up to 5 next architectural layers are denoted by headers of
						lower (2-6) level. These headers have the following syntax:
						<p>
							<code class="non-breaking">
								&lt;archititle&gt; (&lt;file-or-directory-name&gt;) ~&lt;archiname&gt;
							</code>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Deeper layers are represented as elements of a multi-level bulleted list. The form of such
						elements is:
						<p>
							<code class="non-breaking">&lt;archititle&gt; ~&lt;archiname&gt;</code>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>Do <strong>not</strong> mention metafiles in &quot;architecture.md&quot;.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The example below shows the contents of a real &quot;architecture.md&quot; file which had been being
					using in this coding style documentation at one of its development stages.
				</p>
				<iframe src="snippets/architecture.html"></iframe>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="metafiles-workflow"><a href="#contents-metafiles-workflow">workflow.md</a></h3>
				<p>
					A project can define its own set of rules overriding both the general and the per-language
					instructions. Such local rules should be described by an <strong>optional</strong> metafile called
					&quot;<dfn>workflow.md</dfn>&quot; which resides in the root directory of the project and is
					written in Markdown. The form of &quot;workflow.md&quot; is unspecified.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="metafiles-readme"><a href="#contents-metafiles-readme">readme.md</a></h3>
				<p>
					Every project must have a &quot;<dfn>readme.md</dfn>&quot; file within its root directory. This is a
					<strong>Markdown</strong> document which describes the project, defines its goals and ideology,
					gives some basic instructions on building and/or using the product. However, &quot;readme.md&quot;
					is <strong>not</strong> a replacement for regular documentation; it only declares the essentials.
				</p>
				<p>The form of &quot;readme.md&quot; is free except of the following:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>A link to the coding style guide revision used in the current repository is required.</li>
					<li>A link to &quot;workflow.md&quot; is required if the latter exists.</li>
				</ol>
