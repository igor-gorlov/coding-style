				<dd>
					A collective name for several styles of phrase writing in which whitespaces are <strong>not</strong>
					used.
				</dd>
				<dt>Spaceful case</dt>
				<dd>
					A collective name for several styles of phrase writing where spaces are used as word delimiters.
				</dd>
				<dt>Header case</dt>
				<dd>
					A <strong>spaceful</strong> case which capitalizes all <strong>notional</strong> parts of speech
					within the phrase being written, while the first word is <strong>unconditionally</strong>
					capitalized.

						<tr>
							<td>Example</td>
							<td>An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</dd>
				<dt>Upper camel case</dt>

							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>

				</dd>
				<dt>Archient (architectural entity)</dt>
				<dd>
					A relatively independent part of a codebase (for example, a class or a module) which can (but is not

					<code>C++</code>, are <strong>never</strong> considered archients.
				</dd>
				<dt>Archichange (architectural change)</dt>
				<dd>An act of creating, deleting, renaming, replacing or relocating archients.</dd>

				<dd>A short <strong>Git-cased</strong> identifier of an archient.</dd>
				<dt>Archititle (architectural title)</dt>
				<dd>
					A real name of an archient by which this archient is known across the codebase (for example, an
					exact name of a class).
				</dd>
				<dt>File archient</dt>
				<dd>An archient exactly matching a single filesystem object (a file or a directory).</dd>
				<dt>Archiroot (architectural root)</dt>

				<dt>Line terminator</dt>
				<dd>
					A character intended to finish a line of text, also widely known as end-of-line, newline or

					A partition that is directly nested into a subsection and starts with a header of
					<strong>fourth</strong> level.
				</dd>
				<dt>Nanosection</dt>
				<dd>
					A partition that is directly nested into a Microsection and starts with a header of
					<strong>fifth</strong> level.
				</dd>

			<ul>
				<li>Encode all files within a repository in <code>UTF-8</code>.</li>
				<li>Finish any file with a <strong>line terminator</strong>.</li>
				<li>Name the root directory of a project in <strong>Git case</strong>.</li>
				<li>
					Use <strong>lower snake case</strong> to name all files and directories which are (recursively)
					located within the root directory of a project.
				</li>
				<li>Try to compose <strong>brief but understandable</strong> archinames.</li>
				<li>For indentation use <strong>tabs (one per level)</strong>, not spaces.</li>
				<li>Keep line length <strong>not</strong> higher than <strong>120</strong> columns.</li>
				<li>Do <strong>not</strong> write source files consisting of more than <strong>1000</strong> lines.</li>
				<li>
					To simplify creation of new files with initial content or insertion of frequently repeated code
					fragments into existing files, you can make a <code>templates</code> catalog within the root
					directory of your project and store samples there.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="metafiles"><a href="#contents-metafiles">Metafiles</a></h2>
			<p>
				<dfn>Metafiles</dfn> are special helper documents written in <code>Markdown</code> and placed at the top
				level of each project. In fact, they are more of a annotation of the codebase rather than its part. Only
				documents covered in the current section are considered metafiles; various tool-specific configs
				<strong>never</strong> fall into this category.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some metafiles are <strong>mandatory</strong>, others are <strong>optional</strong>; each of them has a
				fixed archiname, which is preserved for this particular metafile and cannot be assigned to any custom
				archient. See the next subsections for details.
			</p>
			<section>
				<h3 id="metafiles-architecture">
					<a href="#contents-metafiles-architecture"><code>architecture.md</code></a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					This <strong>mandatory</strong> metafile maps archititles to appropriate archinames and therefore
					serves as a reminder for developers. Also, <code>architecture.md</code> has an auxiliary function:
					it gives a quick high-level overview of the codebase and helps to understand relations between all
					components. Use archiname <code>arch</code> to mention this document within commit messages.
				</p>
				<p>The following is a set of rules <code>architecture.md</code> must comply with:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The document begins with a <strong>level one header</strong> exactly matching the name of the
						project.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>File</strong> archients of up to five next architectural layers are denoted by headers
						of lower (second&ndash;sixth) level. These headers have the following syntax:
						<p>
							<code class="non-breaking">
								&lt;archititle&gt; (&lt;file-or-directory-name&gt;) ~&lt;archiname&gt;
							</code>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Deeper layers are represented as elements of a multi-level bulleted list. The form of such
						elements is:
						<p>
							<code class="non-breaking">&lt;archititle&gt; ~&lt;archiname&gt;</code>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>Do <strong>not</strong> mention metafiles in <code>architecture.md</code>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The example below shows the contents of a real <code>architecture.md</code> file which had been
					being using in this coding style documentation at one of its development stages.
				</p>
				<iframe src="snippets/architecture.html"></iframe>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="metafiles-workflow">
					<a href="#contents-metafiles-workflow"><code>workflow.md</code></a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					A project can define its own set of rules overriding both the general and the per-language
					instructions. Such local rules are described by an <strong>optional</strong> metafile called
					<code>workflow.md</code>, which has an unspecified form. Its archiname is fixed to
					<code>flow</code>.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="metafiles-readme">
					<a href="#contents-metafiles-readme"><code>readme.md</code></a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Every project must have a <code>readme.md</code> file within its root directory. This document
					describes the project, defines its goals and ideology, gives some basic instructions on building
					and/or using the product. However, <code>readme.md</code> is <strong>not</strong> a replacement for
					regular documentation; it only declares the essentials.
				</p>
				<p>The form of <code>readme.md</code> is free except of the following:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>A link to the coding style guide revision used in the current repository is required.</li>
					<li>A link to <code>workflow.md</code> is required if the latter exists.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The fixed archiname assigned to <code>readme.md</code> is <code>readme</code>.</p>
