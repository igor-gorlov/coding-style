			<b><u>General Coding Style Guidelines by Igor Gorlov</u></b>
		</h1>
		<p>
			The conventions established by this document, as well as ones established by other documents in this
			repository, are strongly encouraged to be followed by every programmer working on my projects. In the
			meantime, all these rules are not dogmas: developers have the right to neglect or even ignore them in
			special cases.

			<p>The following are some common terms used throughout the whole coding style documentation.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong><u>Spaceless case</u></strong></dt>
				<dd>
					A collective name for several styles of phrase writing in which whitespaces are <strong>not</strong>
					used.
				</dd>
				<dt><strong><u>Upper camel case</u></strong></dt>
				<dd>
					A spaceless case where <strong>each</strong> word of the phrase being written begins with a
					<strong>capital letter</strong>.

							<td>Example</td>
							<td>
								SpacesAreNotAllowedHere
							</td>
						</tr>

				</dd>
				<dt><strong><u>Lower camel case</u></strong></dt>
				<dd>
					A spaceless case where <strong>each</strong> word of the phrase being written,
					<strong>except of the first one</strong>, begins with a <strong>capital letter</strong>.
					<table>

							<td>Example</td>
							<td>
								spacesAreNotAllowedHere
							</td>

				<dt><strong><u>Upper snake case</u></strong></dt>

								SPACES_ARE_NOT_ALLOWED_HERE
							</td>
						</tr>

				</dd>
				<dt><strong><u>Lower snake case</u></strong></dt>
				<dd>
					A spaceless case using an <strong>underscore</strong> character (_) as a word separator and
					<strong>totally prohibiting</strong> capital letters.

					A relatively independent part of a codebase (for example, a class or a module) which can (but is not
					required to) include other archients.
				</dd>
				<dt><strong><u>Archichange (architectural change)</u></strong></dt>
				<dd>An act of <strong>creating, deleting, renaming, replacing or relocating</strong> archients.</dd>

				<a href="#contents-system">The System of Coding Rules</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				This document provides a set of rules applicable to all possible projects, regardless of their type or
				the programming languages their are written in. Language-specific rules are defined in separate
				documents and, in case of overlapping, take precedence over the general guidelines; for example,
				&quot;cpp.html&quot; contains information specific to C++.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2 align="center" id="metafiles">
				<a href="#contents-metafiles">Metafiles</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				<i>Metafiles</i> are special helper documents placed at the top level of each project. In fact, they are
				more of a annotation of the codebase rather than its part. Only documents covered in the current section
				are considered metafiles; various tool-specific configs never fall into this category.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some metafiles are <strong>mandatory</strong>, others are <strong>optional</strong>; such status is
				explicitly pointed out for each document (see the next subsections).
			</p>
			<section>
				<h3 align="center" id="metafiles-architecture">
					<a href="#contents-metafiles-architecture">architecture.md</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					This <strong>mandatory</strong> metafile maps real names of architectural units to appropriate names
					used for commit scoping, and therefore serves as a reminder for developers. Also,
					&quot;architecture.md&quot; has an auxiliary function: it gives a quick high-level overview of the
					codebase and helps to understand relationships between all components.
				</p>
				<p>
					The document must remain actual at any time and thus is required to be updated on
					<strong>every architectural change</strong> (that is, whenever an architectural unit appears or
					disappears). The update is performed by the same commit which applies the architectural change
					itself.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 align="center" id="metafiles-workflow">
					<a href="#contents-metafiles-workflow">workflow.md</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					A project can define its own set of rules overriding both the general and the per-language
					instructions. Such local rules should be described by a special document called
					&quot;<strong>workflow.md</strong>&quot; which resides in the root directory of the project and is
					written in Markdown. The form of &quot;workflow.md&quot; is unspecified.
				</p>
				<p>&quot;workflow.md&quot; is an <strong>optional</strong> metafile.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 align="center" id="metafiles-readme">
					<a href="#contents-metafiles-readme">readme.md</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Every project must have a &quot;<i>readme.md</i>&quot; file within its root directory. This is a
					<strong>Markdown</strong> document which describes the project, defines its goals and ideology,
					gives some basic instructions on building and/or using the product. However, &quot;readme.md&quot;
					is <strong>not</strong> a replacement for regular documentation; it only declares the essentials.
				</p>
				<p>The form of &quot;readme.md&quot; is free except of the following:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>A link to the coding style guide revision used in the current repository is required.</li>
					<li>A link to &quot;workflow.md&quot; is required if the latter exists.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>

		<section>
			<h2 align="center" id="language">
				<a href="#contents-language">Natural Language</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				The official language of our community is <strong>English</strong>. It should be used in almost every
				case where natural language is required, including the documentation, file and directory names,
				identifiers within the source code, commit messages, interaction between the community members, and so
				on. In personal communication with me, you can also use Russian.

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Name the root directory of a project in <strong>Git case</strong>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Use <strong>lower snake case</strong> to name <strong>all</strong> files and directories which
						are (recursively) located within the root directory of a project.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Keep line length <strong>not</strong> higher than <strong>120</strong> columns.</p>
				</li>
				<li>

						Do <strong>not</strong> write source files consisting of more than <strong>1000</strong> lines.
