				<a href="#contents-commit-messages">Commit Messages</a>
			</h2>
			<p>
				A well-formed commit message consists of a mandatory <strong>subject line</strong>, an optional
				<strong>body</strong> and an optional <strong>footer</strong>. All these three parts are separated from
				each other by <strong><u>one</u>&nbsp;empty&nbsp;line</strong>. The whole message should be wrapped to
				<strong>72</strong> columns and should <strong>not</strong> refer to any other commits.
			</p>
			<p>In the next subsections, we will consider each part of a commit message in detail.</p>
			<section>
				<h3 id="commit-messages-subject">
					<a href="#contents-commit-messages-subject">Subject Line</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					A subject line is intended to express a <strong>brief summary</strong> of the commit, which may be
					used by various developer tools and services, including (but not limiting to) the GitHub web
					interface and Git itself. In many cases, the only thing that is shown in a commit log being viewed
					by some third-party programmer will be your subject line. Therefore, you have to make it concise and
					abstract, letting a reader to get the high-level sense of the changes represented by this commit.
					Unless it is really necessary, do <strong>not</strong> mention raw filenames in the subject line -
					use <strong>archinames</strong> instead.
				</p>
				<p>Despite the hard length limit, a subject line has its own internal structure:</p>
				<code>
					&lt;<i>type</i>&gt;[ &lt;<i>scope</i>&gt;]: &lt;<i>description</i>&gt;
				</code>
				<p>
					Here, &lt;type&gt; is an identifier denoting the current commit type, &lt;scope&gt; is an optional
					name of the architectural entity this commit is related to, &lt;description&gt; is a very brief
					summary of the changes.
				</p>
				<p>
					All possible commit types are listed in the table below. Please note that in subject lines you have
					to use commit type <strong>identifiers</strong>, not their names.
				</p>
				<table>
					<caption>Commit types</caption>
					<tr>
						<th>Identifier</th>
						<th>Name</th>
						<th>Description</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>fix</td>
						<td>Fix</td>
						<td>Fixes a bug or addresses an issue</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>feat</td>
						<td>Feature</td>
						<td>Adds new functionality</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>mod</td>
						<td>Modification</td>
						<td>
							Changes existing functionality in order to get a new behavior, but <strong>not</strong> to
							fix a bug
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>opt</td>
						<td>Optimization</td>
						<td>
							Reduces the amount of resources needed for execution of the code, such as CPU time, memory
							consumption, binary size etc.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>refactor</td>
						<td>Refactoring</td>
						<td>Restructures the code for readability without any impact on its semantics</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>format</td>
						<td>Format</td>
						<td>Changes formatting of the code, but does <strong>not</strong> affect its meaning at all</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>clean</td>
						<td>Clean</td>
						<td>Removes unneeded code</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>
					A scope is denoted by an appropriate archiname. If the pointed-to architectural entity is nested (is
					a part of a larger archient), you can create a hierarchical identifier using
					<strong>forward&nbsp;slash</strong> (/) as a separator; such scope name will look like a filepath,
					although it hardly ever has something to do with real file system. If the chosen architectural
					entity is the archiroot, a scope name should be omitted.
				</p>
				<p>
					A description is here to answer the question &quot;<strong>what?</strong>&quot; instead of
					&quot;<strong>why?</strong>&quot;. Write in a few words what exactly was done, and leave the reasons
					(if any) for the message body. Please note that you have to use an <strong>imperative mood</strong>
					within the description (write it in the <strong>present tense</strong>), and the use of articles
					(a/an, the) is <strong>not</strong> recommended. Also do <strong>not</strong> start the description
					with a capital letter and do <strong>not</strong> finish it with a period (.).
				</p>
				<p>
					It is possible to refer to another scope by its name right from a description. This trick is very
					helpful in circumstances when you are exceeding the length limit and need to save your characters,
					but the archititle being mentioned is too cumbersome. For example, you have a section with
					archititle &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot; and archiname &quot;faq&quot; in your
					application's user manual. When mentioning this section in a commit description, simply type the
					scope name with a <strong>tilde</strong> (~) at the beginning: <strong>~faq</strong>. That's it, you
					just have saved <strong>22</strong> (<strong>twenty&nbsp;two!</strong>) characters!

			<section>
				<h3 id="commit-messages-body">
					<a href="#contents-commit-messages-body">Body</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					A subject line is typically followed by a body which tells more about the commit in a relatively
					free form. This part of a commit message consists of an arbitrary number of paragraphs separated by
					an <strong>empty&nbsp;line</strong>. Here you can explain the <strong>reasons</strong> the commit
					had been prompted by, add <strong>technical&nbsp;details</strong> and (probably) place additional
					information.
				</p>
				<p>
					A body is <strong>less</strong> abstract than a subject line, so you are allowed to use raw
					filenames, not only scope references. However, avoid abusing this low level style - do
					<strong>not</strong> turn your commit message into pseudocode.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="commit-messages-footer">
					<a href="#contents-commit-messages-footer">Footer</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					A footer is used only for &quot;<strong>Fix</strong>&quot; commits to point to the problem being
					solved. Like a subject line, a footer occupies strictly <strong>one</strong> 72-column row. It
					consists of a <strong>hash&nbsp;sign</strong> (#), immediately followed by a number identifying the
					addressed issue: <strong>#123456</strong>.

				<h3 id="branching-terminology">
					<a href="#contents-branching-terminology">Terminology</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Here is the basic set of terms needed to get started with Igor Gorlov's branching model. Additional
					terms will be introduced later during further explanation.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Workable program</dt>
					<dd>
						A program that <strong>compiles</strong> (if required), <strong>runs</strong> and
						<strong>passes all tests</strong> (if any).
					</dd>
					<dt>Readable documentation</dt>
					<dd>
						Unambiguous and consistent documentation which has <strong>no</strong> internal contradictions
						and/or incomplete sections, but (probably) still needs additions and/or improvements.
					</dd>
					<dt>Solid state</dt>
					<dd>
						A codebase is considered to be in a solid state when <strong>all</strong> of the following
						conditions are met:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>Its program part (if present) is <strong>workable</strong>.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Its documentation part (if present) is <strong>readable</strong>.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>It conforms to the coding style rules.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
					<dt>Unstable state</dt>
					<dd>
						A codebase is considered to be in an unstable state when <strong>one or more</strong> of the
						solid state conditions are <strong>false</strong>.
					</dd>
					<dt>Solid commit</dt>
					<dd>A commit pointing to a codebase snapshot which is in a <strong>solid state</strong>.</dd>
					<dt>Unstable commit</dt>
					<dd>A commit pointing to a codebase snapshot which is in an <strong>unstable state</strong>.</dd>
					<dt>Solid branch</dt>
					<dd>A branch requiring <strong>every</strong> its commit to be <strong>solid</strong>.</dd>
					<dt>Unstable branch</dt>
					<dd>A branch on which <strong>unstable</strong> commits are permitted.</dd>
				</dl>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="branching-overview">
					<a href="#contents-branching-overview">Overview</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Every repository is built around the default branch called &quot;<strong>dev</strong>&quot;. This is
					a <strong>solid</strong> branch, it represents the main stream of development. Ideally, the whole
					history of the project should be linearly stored on &quot;dev&quot; as a series of small and
					distinct commits.
				</p>
				<p>However, such scenario is often not viable in real world:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p id="branching-overview-issue1">
							The first obstacle comes from inherent complexity of any software which is larger than a
							code example from a beginners' manual. The more abstraction layers your project consists of,
							the harder it becomes both to retain a solid state and to keep commits compact
							simultaneously.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p id="branching-overview-issue2">
							Another problem appears when the upcoming release is getting close. You have to perform
							several final touches before announcing a new version, but suddenly understand that those
							touches are really not needed on &quot;dev&quot; - they will hamper the future work. For
							example, there is absolutely no necessity to improve quality of visual design if you are
							planning to completely revisit the GUI right after the upcoming release.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The branching strategy covered in the remaining subsections proposes several workarounds for the
					issues listed above.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="branching-encapsulation">
					<a href="#contents-branching-encapsulation">Encapsulation Branches</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					To resolve the <a href="#branching-overview-issue1">first issue</a>, we add some kind of complexity
					management using temporary unstable branches (hereinafter -
					<strong>encapsulation&nbsp;branches</strong>). When a complex task rises, create a new branch, do
					all unstable work on it, then merge back into &quot;dev&quot;, and finally delete the encapsulation
					branch.
				</p>
				<p>Despite that this process is very intuitive, a set of mandatory rules exists:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							The branch name must be written in <strong>Git case</strong>. If the name is hierarchical,
							replace the separating slash (/) with a <strong>hyphen</strong> (-).
						</p>
						<table>
							<caption>Examples</caption>
							<tr>
								<th>Source hierarchical name</th>
								<th>Resulting branch name</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>core/loader</td>
								<td>core-loader</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>file-manager/search</td>
								<td>file-manager-search</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>audio-formats/lossy/mp3</td>
								<td>audio-formats-lossy-mp3</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							A prefix denoting the type of the merge commit being planned must precede the branch name;
							the name and the prefix must be separated by a <strong>slash</strong> (/).
						</p>
						<table>
							<caption>Examples</caption>
							<tr>
								<td>Develop a new big class named &quot;TextParser&quot;</td>
								<td>feat/text-parser</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Refactor a &quot;Network&quot; module consisting of many classes</td>
								<td>refactor/network</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									Rewrite a &quot;Server&quot; class which is a member of the &quot;Network&quot;
									module
								</td>
								<td>mod/network-server</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>Always</strong> create a merge commit; avoid fast-forward merges.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Provide the merge commit with an informative <a href="#commit-messages">message</a>; do
							<strong>not</strong> leave the default one.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The abuse of encapsulation branches can lead to an overcomplicated repository structure; so,
							avoid creating them recursively in order to keep any encapsulation branch
							<strong>linear</strong>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p id="branching-encapsulation-splitting-rule">
							Keep all commits <strong>small and logically separated</strong>; if you have a complex task,
							break it down into simpler ones.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="branching-release">
					<a href="#contents-branching-release">Release Branches</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					This addresses the <a href="#branching-overview-issue2">second issue</a>. If the new version of your
					product needs additional pre-release tuning which has nothing to do with the subsequent (starting
					after this new version) development, create a dedicated <i>release&nbsp;branch</i> and do all the
					preparatory work there. When the project is absolutely ready to be released, tag the tip of the
					release branch, and you are done. However, if you maintain several generations of the product in
					parallel (like Microsoft does with its Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems), it might be
					sine to develop updates and fixes for each generation right on that generation's release branch
					(after the major release tag). Anyway, a release branch persistently remains alive and
					<strong>never</strong> gets deleted.
				</p>
				<p>
					Release branches are <strong>solid</strong>. Similarly to &quot;dev&quot;, any of them can be (but
					not always is) a base for its own encapsulation branches.
				</p>
				<p>
					A special &quot;<i>rel</i>&quot; prefix is used to clearly indicate a release branch; the prefix and
					the branch name are separated by a <strong>slash</strong> (/): <strong>rel/v1</strong>.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 id="branching-initial">
					<a href="#contents-branching-initial">Initial Commit</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					A new repository may begin its life either from scratch (when there are no files yet) or by
					importing an existing codebase. Regardless of the origin of the contents being added, the history of
					the project has to start from some <i>initial&nbsp;commit</i>, which is the root of &quot;dev&quot;
					branch and thus must be <strong>solid</strong>. An initial commit is special in the sense that its
					message requirements have nothing to do with the regular
					<a href="#commit-messages">commit message rules</a> (see next paragraphs for details). Also, by
					definition, it is impossible for a repository to have more than 1 initial commit as well as not to
					have it at all; therefore, the initial commit is always unique within particular history.
				</p>
				<p>
					In case of existing code, <strong>all</strong> imported data should be included in one
					<strong>monolithic</strong> initial commit. This is an exception to the
					<a href="#branching-encapsulation-splitting-rule">rule which requires commits to be small</a>. Such
					initial commit is equipped with a message <strong>exactly</strong> matching the text below:
				</p>
				<blockquote>Import project</blockquote>
				<p>
					When creating a project from scratch, the initial commit must consist of
					<a href="general.html#metafiles-readme">&quot;readme.md&quot;</a> and
					<a href="general.html#metafiles-architecture">&quot;architecture.md&quot;</a> documents. The former
					metafile follows the regular conventions established for &quot;readme.md&quot;; the latter must only
					have the <strong>top&#8209;level&nbsp;header</strong> inside it. The commit message will look
					<strong>exactly</strong> as follows:
				</p>
				<blockquote>Initialize project</blockquote>
