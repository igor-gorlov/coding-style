			<b><u>Version Control Guide by Igor Gorlov</u></b>
		</h1>
		<p>
			In my work, I use <a href="https://git-scm.com"><strong>Git</strong></a> as the only version control system.
			All my projects are Git repositories remotely hosted on
			<a href="https://github.com"><strong>GitHub</strong></a> under
			<a href="https://github.com/igor-gorlov"><strong>Igor Gorlov personal account</strong></a>.

			<p>
				A well-formed commit message consists of a mandatory <strong>subject line</strong>, an optional
				<strong>body</strong> and an optional <strong>footer</strong>. The whole message should be wrapped to
				<strong>72</strong> columns.
			</p>
			<p>In the next subsections, we will consider each part of a commit message in detail.</p>
			<section>
				<h3 align="center" id="commit-messages-subject">
					<a href="#contents-commit-messages-subject">Subject Line</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					A subject line is intended to express a <strong>brief summary</strong> of the commit, which may be
					used by various developer tools and services, including (but not limiting to) the GitHub web
					interface and Git itself. In many cases, the only thing that is shown in a commit log being viewed
					by some third-party programmer will be your subject line. Therefore, you have to make it concise and
					abstract, letting a reader to get the high-level sense of the changes represented by this commit.
					Unless it is really necessary, do <strong>not</strong> mention raw filenames in the subject line -
					use more abstract entities from the project architecture instead (for example, module names).
				</p>
				<p>Despite the hard length limit, a subject line has its own internal structure:</p>
				<code>
					&lt;<i>type</i>&gt; &lt;<i>scope</i>&gt;: &lt;<i>description</i>&gt;
				</code>
				<p>
					Here, &lt;type&gt; is an identifier denoting the current commit type, &lt;scope&gt; is a name of the
					architectural entity this commit is related to, &lt;description&gt; is a very brief summary of the
					changes.
				</p>
				<p>All possible commit types are listed in the table below.</p>
				<table>
					<caption>Commit types</caption>
					<tr>
						<th>Identifier</th>
						<th>Name</th>
						<th>Description</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>fix</td>
						<td>Fix</td>
						<td>Fixes a bug or addresses an issue</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>feat</td>
						<td>Feature</td>
						<td>Adds new functionality</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>opt</td>
						<td>Optimization</td>
						<td>
							Reduces the amount of resources needed for execution of the code, such as CPU time, memory
							consumption, binary size etc.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>refactor</td>
						<td>Refactoring</td>
						<td>Restructures the code for readability without any impact on its semantics</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>
					A scope can be denoted by an arbitrary <strong>Git-cased</strong> name transparently related to one
					of the structural units of the project. If the chosen unit is nested (is a part of a larger unit),
					you can create a hierarchical name using <strong>forward&nbsp;slash</strong> (/) as a separator;
					such name will look like a filepath, although it hardly ever has something to do with real file
					system.
				</p>
				<p>
					A description is here to answer the question "<strong>what?</strong>" instead of
					"<strong>why?</strong>". Write in a few words what exactly was done, and leave the reasons (if any)
					for the message body. Please note that you have to use an <strong>imperative mood</strong> within
					the description: write it in the <strong>present tense</strong>. Also do <strong>not</strong> finish
					the description with a period (.).
