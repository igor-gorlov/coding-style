				<h2 id="archichanges"><a href="#contents-archichanges">Archichanges</a></h2>
				<p>
					The <a href="general.html#metafiles-architecture"><code>architecture.md</code> metafile</a> must
					remain actual at any time and thus is required to be updated on <strong>every archichange</strong>.
					The update is performed by the <strong>same</strong> commit which applies the architectural change
					itself.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2 id="commit-messages"><a href="#contents-commit-messages">Commit Messages</a></h2>
				<p>
					A well-formed commit message consists of a mandatory <dfn>subject line</dfn> and an optional
					<dfn>body</dfn>. These two parts are separated from each other by <strong>one empty line</strong>.
					The whole message must be wrapped to <strong>seventy-two</strong> columns and must
					<strong>not</strong> refer to any other commits.
				</p>
				<p>In the next subsections, we will consider each part of a commit message in detail.</p>
				<section>
					<h3 id="commit-messages-subject"><a href="#contents-commit-messages-subject">Subject Line</a></h3>
					<p>
						A subject line is intended to express a <strong>brief summary</strong> of the commit, which may
						be used by various developer tools and services, including (but not limiting to) the GitHub web
						interface and Git itself. In many cases, the only thing that is shown in a commit log being
						viewed by some third-party programmer will be your subject line. Therefore, you have to make it
						concise and abstract, letting a reader to get the high-level sense of the changes represented by
						this commit. Unless it is really necessary, do <strong>not</strong> mention raw filenames in the
						subject line&nbsp;&mdash; use <strong>archinames</strong> instead.
					</p>
					<p>Despite the hard length limit, a subject line has its own internal structure:</p>
					<code> &lt;type&gt;[ &lt;scope&gt;][: &lt;description&gt;] </code>
					<p>
						Here, <code>&lt;type&gt;</code> is an identifier denoting the current commit type,
						<code>&lt;scope&gt;</code> is an optional name of the architectural entity this commit is
						related to, <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> is a very brief summary of the changes (also
						optional).
					</p>
					<section>
						<h4>Commit Type</h4>
						<p>
							All possible commit types are listed in the table below. Please note that in subject lines
							you have to use commit type <strong>identifiers</strong>, not their names.
						</p>
						<table>
							<caption>
								Commit Types
							</caption>
							<tr>
								<th>Identifier</th>
								<th>Name</th>
								<th>Description</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><code>fix</code></td>
								<td>Fix</td>
								<td>Fixes a bug or addresses an issue</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><code>feat</code></td>
								<td>Feature</td>
								<td>Adds new functionality</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><code>mod</code></td>
								<td>Modification</td>
								<td>
									Changes existing functionality in order to get a new behavior but
									<strong>not</strong>
									to fix a bug
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><code>opt</code></td>
								<td>Optimization</td>
								<td>
									Reduces the amount of resources needed for execution of the code, such as CPU time,
									memory consumption, binary size etc.
								</td>

								<td><code>ref</code></td>
								<td>Refactoring</td>
								<td>Restructures the code for readability without any impact on its semantics</td>

								<td>Format</td>
								<td>
									Changes formatting of the code, but does <strong>not</strong> affect its meaning at
									all

								<td><code>clean</code></td>
								<td>Clean</td>
								<td>Removes unneeded code</td>
							</tr>
						</table>

						<h4>Commit Scope</h4>
						<p>
							A scope is denoted by an appropriate archiname. If the pointed-to architectural entity is
							nested (is a part of a larger archient), you can create a hierarchical identifier using
							<strong>forward slash (/)</strong> as a separator; such scope name will look like a
							filepath, although it hardly ever has something to do with real file system. If the chosen
							architectural entity is the archiroot, omit a scope name.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Commit Description</h4>
						<p>
							A description is here to answer the question &ldquo;<strong>what?</strong>&rdquo; instead of
							&ldquo;<strong>why?</strong>&rdquo;. Write in a few words what exactly was done and leave
							the reasons (if any) for the message body. Apart from the above, the following rules are
							applied:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Use an <strong>imperative mood</strong> within a description (write it in the
								<strong>present tense</strong>).
							</li>
							<li>The use of articles (a/an, the) is <strong>not</strong> recommended.</li>
							<li>Do <strong>not</strong> start a description with a capital letter.</li>
							<li>Do <strong>not</strong> finish a description with a period (.).</li>
							<li>Within a description, write all numbers <strong>digitally</strong>.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							It is possible to refer to another scope by its name right from a description. This trick is
							very helpful in circumstances when you are exceeding the length limit and need to save your
							characters, but the archititle being mentioned is too cumbersome. For example, you have a
							section with archititle &ldquo;Frequently Asked Questions&rdquo; and archiname
							<code>faq</code> in your application's user manual. When mentioning this section in a commit
							description, simply type the scope name with a <strong>tilde (~)</strong> at the beginning:
							<code>~faq</code>. That's it, you just have saved <strong>twenty-two</strong> characters!
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Subject Line Examples</h4>

							<li>
								<code class="non-breaking">fix ui/input/keyboard: correct handling of arrow keys</code>
							</li>

					<h3 id="commit-messages-body"><a href="#contents-commit-messages-body">Body</a></h3>
					<p>
						A subject line is typically followed by a body, which tells more about the commit in a
						relatively free form. This part of a commit message consists of an arbitrary number of
						paragraphs separated by an <strong>empty line</strong>. Here you can explain the
						<strong>reasons</strong> the commit had been prompted by, add
						<strong>technical details</strong>, and (probably) place additional information.
					</p>
					<p>
						A body is <strong>less</strong> abstract than a subject line, so you are allowed to use raw
						filenames, not only scope references. However, avoid abusing this low level style&nbsp;&mdash;
						do <strong>not</strong> turn your commit message into pseudocode.
					</p>
				</section>

				<h2 id="branching"><a href="#contents-branching">Branching</a></h2>
				<section>
					<h3 id="branching-overview"><a href="#contents-branching-overview">Overview</a></h3>
					<p>
						Every repository is built around the default branch called <strong><code>dev</code></strong
						>. This is a <strong>solid</strong> branch, it represents the main stream of development.
						Ideally, the whole history of the project should be linearly stored on <code>dev</code> as a
						series of small and distinct commits.
					</p>
					<p>However, such scenario is often not viable in real world:</p>
					<ul>
						<li id="branching-overview-issue1">
							The first obstacle comes from inherent complexity of any software which is larger than a
							code example from a beginners' manual. The more abstraction layers your project consists of,
							the harder it becomes both to retain a solid state and to keep commits compact
							simultaneously.
						</li>
						<li id="branching-overview-issue2">
							Another problem appears when the upcoming release is getting close. You have to perform
							several final touches before announcing a new version, but suddenly understand that those
							touches are really not needed on <code>dev</code>&nbsp;&mdash; they will hamper the future
							work. For example, there is absolutely no necessity to improve quality of visual design if
							you are planning to completely revisit the GUI right after the upcoming release.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The branching strategy covered in the remaining subsections proposes several workarounds for the
						issues listed above.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3 id="branching-encapsulation">
						<a href="#contents-branching-encapsulation">Encapsulation Branches</a>
					</h3>
					<p>
						To resolve the <a href="#branching-overview-issue1">first issue</a>, we add some kind of
						complexity management using temporary unstable branches (hereinafter&nbsp;&mdash;
						<dfn>encapsulation branches</dfn>). When a complex task rises, create a new branch, do all
						unstable work on it, then merge back into <code>dev</code>, and finally delete the encapsulation
						branch.
					</p>
					<p>Despite that this process is very intuitive, a set of mandatory rules exists:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The branch name must be written in <strong>Git case</strong>. If the name is hierarchical,
							replace the separating slash (/) with a <strong>hyphen (-)</strong>.
							<table>
								<caption>
									Examples
								</caption>
								<tr>
									<th>Source hierarchical name</th>
									<th>Resulting branch name</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><code>core/loader</code></td>
									<td><code>core-loader</code></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><code>file-manager/search</code></td>
									<td><code>file-manager-search</code></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><code>audio-formats/lossy/mp3</code></td>
									<td><code>audio-formats-lossy-mp3</code></td>
								</tr>
							</table>
						</li>
						<li>
							A prefix denoting the type of the merge commit being planned must precede the branch name;
							the name and the prefix must be separated by <strong>slash (/)</strong>.
							<table>
								<caption>
									Examples
								</caption>
								<tr>
									<td>Develop a new big class named <code>TextParser</code></td>
									<td><code>feat/text-parser</code></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Refactor a <code>Network</code> module consisting of many classes</td>
									<td><code>ref/network</code></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>
										Rewrite a <code>Server</code> class which is a member of the
										<code>Network</code>
										module
									</td>
									<td><code>mod/network-server</code></td>
								</tr>
							</table>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Always</strong> create a merge commit; avoid fast-forward merges.</li>
						<li>
							Provide the merge commit with an informative <a href="#commit-messages">message</a>; do
							<strong>not</strong> leave the default one.
						</li>
						<li>
							The abuse of encapsulation branches can lead to an overcomplicated repository structure; so
							avoid creating them recursively in order to keep any encapsulation branch
							<strong>linear</strong>.
						</li>
						<li id="branching-encapsulation-splitting-rule">
							Keep all commits <strong>small and logically separated</strong>; if you have a complex task,
							break it down into simpler ones.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3 id="branching-release"><a href="#contents-branching-release">Release Branches</a></h3>
					<p>
						This addresses the <a href="#branching-overview-issue2">second issue</a>. If the new version of
						your product needs additional pre-release tuning which has nothing to do with the subsequent
						(starting after this new version) development, create a dedicated <dfn>release branch</dfn> and
						do all the preparatory work there. When the project is absolutely ready to be released, tag the
						tip of the release branch, and you are done. However, if you maintain several generations of the
						product in parallel (like Microsoft does with its
						<span class="non-breaking">Windows 10</span> and
						<span class="non-breaking">Windows 11</span> operating systems), it might be sine to develop
						updates and fixes for each generation right on that generation's release branch (after the major
						release tag). Anyway, a release branch persistently remains alive and
						<strong>never</strong> gets deleted.
					</p>
					<p>
						Release branches are <strong>solid</strong>. Similarly to <code>dev</code>, any of them can be
						(but not always is) a base for its own encapsulation branches.
					</p>
					<p>
						A special <code>rel</code> prefix is used to clearly indicate a release branch; the prefix and
						the branch name are separated by a <strong>slash (/)</strong>: <code>rel/v1</code>.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3 id="branching-initial"><a href="#contents-branching-initial">The Initial Commit</a></h3>
					<p>
						A new repository may begin its life either from scratch (when there are no files yet) or by
						importing an existing codebase. Regardless of the origin of the contents being added, the
						history of the project has to start from some <dfn>initial commit</dfn>, which is the root of
						<code>dev</code> branch and thus must be <strong>solid</strong>. An initial commit is special in
						the sense that its message requirements have nothing to do with the regular
						<a href="#commit-messages"><span class="non-breaking">commit message rules</span></a> (see next
						paragraphs for details). Also, by definition, it is impossible for a repository to have more
						than 1 initial commit as well as not to have it at all; therefore, the initial commit is always
						unique within particular history.
					</p>
					<p>
						In case of existing code, <strong>all</strong> imported data must be included in
						<strong>one</strong> monolithic initial commit. This is an exception to the
						<a href="#branching-encapsulation-splitting-rule">rule which requires commits to be small</a>.
						Such initial commit is equipped with a message <strong>exactly</strong> matching the text below:
					</p>
					<p>
						<code class="non-breaking">Import project</code>
					</p>
					<p>
						When creating a project from scratch, the initial commit must consist of
						<a href="general.html#metafiles-readme"><code>readme.md</code></a> and
						<a href="general.html#metafiles-architecture"><code>architecture.md</code></a> documents. The
						former metafile follows the regular conventions established for <code>readme.md</code>; the
						latter must only have the <strong>top-level header</strong> inside it. The commit message will
						look <strong>exactly</strong> as follows:
					</p>
					<p>
						<code class="non-breaking">Initialize project</code>
