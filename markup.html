		<h1>Markup Guide by Igor Gorlov</h1>
		<p>
			This guide aims to define both visual and semantic structure which, in my opinion, is optimal for the
			overwhelming majority of technical documents. No specific markup languages are discussed here because many
			of them have well-known generic subset of features (like multilevel headers and bulleted lists). However,
			some of the rules below involve advanced styling provided by powerful solutions (for example,
			<code class="non-breaking">HTML + CSS</code>) but not supported in lightweight systems (such as
			<code>Markdown</code>). In the meantime, complex technologies could be a bad choice when you need to quickly
			write a simple document for which the contents is much more important than its visual representation. In the
			latter case, full-featured solutions usually produce a lot of boilerplate and hence should be given up in
			favor of more primitive tools. It is absolutely fair: a developer have all rights to select a method that
			works better on the current task. If your chosen technology doesn't implement a particular feature, feel
			free to ignore all rules that require this feature.
