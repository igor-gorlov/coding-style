		<h1>Markup Guide by Igor Gorlov</h1>
		<p>
			This guide aims to define both visual and semantic structure which, in my opinion, is optimal for the
			overwhelming majority of technical documents. No specific markup languages are discussed here because many
			of them have well-known generic subset of features (like multilevel headers and bulleted lists). However,
			some of the rules below involve advanced styling provided by powerful solutions (for example,
			<code class="non-breaking">HTML + CSS</code>) but not supported in lightweight systems (such as
			<code>Markdown</code>). In the meantime, complex technologies could be a bad choice when you need to quickly
			write a simple document for which the contents is much more important than its visual representation. In the
			latter case, full-featured solutions usually produce a lot of boilerplate and hence should be given up in
			favor of more primitive tools. It is absolutely fair: a developer have all rights to select a method that
			works better on the current task. If your chosen technology doesn't implement a particular feature, feel
			free to ignore all rules that require this feature.

				<dd>Text written in a <strong>natural</strong> language and bearing the main semantic load.</dd>
				<dt>Computer text</dt>
				<dd>
					Text that is one or more of the following:
					<ul>
						<li>Written in one of programming languages or in pseudocode.</li>
						<li>Output of a computer program.</li>
						<li>Input made by a user of a computer.</li>

							Names representing hardware or software components of a computing system, such as CPU
							architecture, OS version, installed applications, and so on.

				<dt>Exclusive emphasis technique (EET)</dt>
				<dd>
					A method of text highlighting that is <strong>never</strong> combined with other exclusive emphasis
					techniques (including itself).
				</dd>
				<dt>Code emphasis</dt>
				<dd>
					An exclusive emphasis technique which uses a <strong>monospaced</strong> font and (if possible)
					semantically marks the text being emphasized as <strong>program code</strong> (for example, with
					<code>&lt;code&gt;</code> HTML tag).
				</dd>
				<dt>Term introduction emphasis (TIE)</dt>
				<dd>
					An exclusive emphasis technique that works on a <strong>short</strong> text fragment and makes it
					<strong>non-breaking italic</strong>.
				</dd>
				<dt>Important fragment emphasis (IFE)</dt>
				<dd>
					An exclusive emphasis technique that works on a <strong>short</strong> text fragment and makes it
					<strong>non-breaking bold</strong>.
				</dd>
				<dt>Emphasis conflict</dt>
				<dd>
					A situation when more than 1 exclusive emphasis technique should theoretically be applied to the
					same word or phrase.
				</dd>
				<dt>Combinable emphasis technique (CET)</dt>
				<dd>
					A method of text highlighting permitted to be used in combination with any number of other
					highlighting methods including itself.
				</dd>
				<dt>Internal link</dt>
				<dd>A hyperlink referring to an element of the <strong>same</strong> document it is located in.</dd>
				<dt>Typographic quotes</dt>
				<dd>
					In Igor Gorlov's coding style documentation, this term refers to
					<strong>double quotation marks</strong>. Their most important properties are described in the
					following table:
					<table>
						<tr>
							<th></th>
							<th>Glyph</th>
							<th>Hexadecimal <code>Unicode</code> number</th>
							<th>Decimal <code>Unicode</code> number</th>
							<th><code>HTML</code> entity</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Left (opening) double quote</td>
							<td>&ldquo;</td>
							<td>U+201C</td>
							<td>8220</td>
							<td><code>&amp;ldquo;</code></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Right (closing) double quote</td>
							<td>&rdquo;</td>
							<td>U+201D</td>
							<td>8221</td>
							<td><code>&amp;rdquo;</code></td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</dd>
				<dt>Neutral quotes</dt>
				<dd>
					In Igor Gorlov's coding style documentation, this term refers to the standard
					<strong>typewriter quotation marks</strong>. Both their opening and closing variants have identical
					glyphs (&quot;), <code>Unicode</code> numbers (hexadecimal &mdash; U+0022, decimal &mdash; 34), and
					<code>HTML</code> entities (<code>&amp;quot;</code>).

			<ul>
				<li>
					Begin a document with a title in the form of a <dfn>top-level header</dfn> (that is, a
					<strong>header of level 1</strong>). There must be <strong>exactly one</strong> top-level header in
					each individual document.
				</li>
				<li>Split large documents into logical <i>sections</i> with <strong>headers of level 2</strong>.</li>
				<li>
					Split large sections into logical <dfn>subsections</dfn> with <strong>headers of level 3</strong>.
				</li>
				<li>
					If a section or a subsection can be presented as a sequence of short statements, split it into
					<dfn>clauses</dfn> by using a (potentially multi-level) <strong>list</strong>.
				</li>
				<li>
					If a section or a subsection can be presented as a sequence of statements, but these statements are
					too long, make regular <strong>paragraphs</strong> instead of clauses.
				</li>
				<li>Clauses and paragraphs can be mixed up together within a section or a subsection.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>Always use a <strong>proportional</strong> font for natural text.</li>
				<li>Use <strong>code emphasis</strong> for all computer text.</li>
				<li>Use <strong>term introduction emphasis</strong> for the first occurrence of every new term.</li>
				<li>Use <strong>important fragment emphasis</strong> for the most valuable words and phrases.</li>
				<li>
					TIE and IFE highlightings should <strong>not</strong> span long pieces of text (only critical
					fragments are to be emphasized) and should <strong>not</strong> appear too frequently.

					If an emphasis conflict takes place, the exclusive technique which is higher in the following
					priority list is picked:
					<ol>
						<li>Code emphasis.</li>
						<li>Term introduction emphasis.</li>
						<li>Important fragment emphasis.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Set <strong>blue</strong> color for links, do <strong>not</strong> underline them.</li>
				<li>
					Highlight headers of all levels with <strong>bold</strong>; the top-level header
					<strong>should</strong> be underlined.
				</li>
				<li>
					The highlighting methods for headers and links are considered
					<strong>Combinable emphasis techniques</strong> with all the ensuing consequences.

					<strong>no</strong> markers preceding the elements.
				</li>
				<li>
					If a table of contents is present, the document is also required to have
					<code class="non-breaking">Back to the table of contents</code> link at the bottom.
				</li>
				<li>Use typographic quotes if they are supported; consider neutral ones a fallback.</li>

					Quotation marks (&quot;...&quot;) are used around:
