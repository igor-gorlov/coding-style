		<h1>Markup Guide by Igor Gorlov</h1>
		<p>
			This guide aims to define both visual and semantic structure which, in my opinion, is optimal for the
			overwhelming majority of technical documents. No specific markup languages are discussed here, cause many of
			them have well-known generic subset of features (like multilevel headers and bulleted lists). However, some
			of the rules below involve advanced styling provided by powerful solutions (for example,
			<span class="non-breaking">HTML + CSS</span>) but not supported in lightweight systems (such as Markdown).
			In the meantime, complex technologies could be a bad choice when you need quickly write a simple document
			for which the contents is much more important than its visual representation. In the latter case,
			full-featured solutions usually produce a lot of boilerplate and hence should be given up in favor of more
			primitive tools. It is absolutely fair: a developer have all rights to select a method that works better on
			the current task. If your chosen technology doesn't implement a particular feature, feel free to ignore all
			rules that require this feature.

				<dt>Exclusive emphasis technique (EET)</dt>
				<dd>
					A method of text highlighting that is <strong>never</strong> combined with other exclusive emphasis
					techniques (including itself).
				</dd>
				<dt>Code emphasis</dt>
				<dd>
					An exclusive emphasis technique which uses a <strong>monospaced</strong> font and (if possible)
					semantically marks the text being emphasized as <strong>program code</strong> (for example, with
					<code>&lt;code&gt;</code> HTML tag).
				</dd>
				<dt>Term introduction emphasis (TIE)</dt>
				<dd>
					An exclusive emphasis technique that works on a <strong>short</strong> text fragment and makes it
					<strong>non-breaking italic</strong>.
				</dd>
				<dt>Important fragment emphasis (IFE)</dt>
				<dd>
					An exclusive emphasis technique that works on a <strong>short</strong> text fragment and makes it
					<strong>non-breaking bold</strong>.

				<dt>Emphasis conflict</dt>
				<dd>
					A situation when more than 1 exclusive emphasis technique should theoretically be applied to the
					same word or phrase.
				</dd>
				<dt>Combinable emphasis technique (CET)</dt>
				<dd>
					A method of text highlighting permitted to be used in combination with any number of other
					highlighting methods including itself.

				<li>
					Begin a document with a title in the form of a <dfn>top-level header</dfn> (that is, a header of
					level <strong>1</strong>). There must be <strong>exactly one</strong> top-level header in each
					individual document.
				</li>
				<li>
					Split large documents into logical <i>sections</i> with
					<strong>headers&nbsp;of&nbsp;level&nbsp;2</strong>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Split large sections into logical <dfn>subsections</dfn> with <strong>headers of level 3</strong>.
				</li>
				<li>
					If a section or a subsection can be presented as a sequence of short statements, split it into
					<dfn>clauses</dfn> by using a (potentially multi-level) <strong>list</strong>.
				</li>
				<li>
					If a section or a subsection can be presented as a sequence of statements, but these statements are
					too long, make regular <strong>paragraphs</strong> instead of clauses.
				</li>
				<li>Clauses and paragraphs can be mixed up together within a section or a subsection.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="emphasis"><a href="#contents-emphasis">Emphasis</a></h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Always use a <strong>proportional</strong> font for natural text.</li>
				<li>Use <strong>code emphasis</strong> for all computer text.</li>
				<li>Use <strong>term introduction emphasis</strong> for the first occurrence of every new term.</li>
				<li>Use <strong>important fragment emphasis</strong> for the most valuable words and phrases.</li>
				<li>
					TIE and IFE highlightings should <strong>not</strong> span long pieces of text (only critical
					fragments are to be emphasized) and should <strong>not</strong> appear too frequently.

				<li>
					If an emphasis conflict takes place, the exclusive technique which is higher in the following
					priority list is picked:
					<ol>
						<li>Code emphasis.</li>
						<li>Term introduction emphasis.</li>
						<li>Important fragment emphasis.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Set <strong>blue</strong> color for links, do <strong>not</strong> underline them.</li>
				<li>
					Highlight headers of all levels with <strong>bold</strong>; the top-level header
					<strong>should</strong> be underlined.
				</li>
				<li>
					The highlighting methods for headers and links are considered
					<strong>Combinable emphasis techniques</strong> with all the ensuing consequences.
