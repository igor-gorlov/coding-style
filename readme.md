This is the source code repository for
[Igor Gorlov's coding style documentation](https://igor-gorlov.github.io/coding-style) -- a static website defining my
personal view of programming.

The site internally relies on background HTTP requests and, as a consequence, requires a **web server** in order to
operate successfully. Don't try to open locally cloned HTML documents in a browser -- the result will be unexpected and
frustrating. If you are desperate for having an offline version, install [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org) (or
[nginx](https://nginx.org), or any other server) and configure access to the repo on your localhost. By the way, if you
wish to contribute, the described procedure is definitely your only option.

When making any changes to the codebase, please adhere to the
[revision 1](https://igor-gorlov.github.io/coding-style/rev1) of the coding style documentation itself and to the
[special workflow notes](workflow.md).
